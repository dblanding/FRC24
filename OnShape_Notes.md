## OnShape Training
1. If you're a beginner at CAD, start with this series of 5 tutorials by CADSessions: [Beginner Tutorial 1/5 - Onshape 3D CAD - Creating Sketches and Objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMWnsHpDlQE)

2. Once you have learned the basics, I reccomend OnShape's self-paced online tutorials (with Exercises) at [OnShape Learning Pathways](https://learn.onshape.com/)
