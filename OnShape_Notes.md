## Onshape Training
1. If you're a beginner at CAD, start with this series of 5 tutorials by CADSessions: [Beginner Tutorial 1/5 - Onshape 3D CAD - Creating Sketches and Objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMWnsHpDlQE)

2. Once you have learned the basics, I recommend Onshape's self-paced online tutorials (with Exercises) at [Onshape Learning Pathways](https://learn.onshape.com/)

![Learning Pathways](imgs/learning_pathways.png)

* And they provide a [Dashboard](https://learn.onshape.com/learn/dashboard) 
to keep track of your completed training:

    * Makes a good case for explaining why all the various teams need to have access to CAD model:
        * Design (obviously)
        * Fabrication & build
        * Electrical
        * Programming
        * Marketing (Can pull out phone and show design)
    * Explains *Single Document* vs *Multi-Document* organization
    * Demos how to install and use MKCAD library
    * Suggests the exercise to use the MKCAD libray to build last year's robot.
    * Introduces featurescript to generate custom features
        * Shows a *chain* example using `Julia's Featurescripts`
        * Demonstrates generating a hex shaft
    * Shows collaboration
        * Follow mode
        * Comments
        * Versions & history
    * Covers available learning resources

            * Learned some things along the way
                * Used featurescripts
                    * Extrude Individual
                    * Tube Converter
                * Inserting from MKCad (Parts vs. Assys)
                * Needed to "Dissolve" replicates (bearing & T-gusset)
